##The objective of this task is to develop a C++ application that performs file compression and decompression using multithreading for performance optimization. The program should:

Compress files by splitting them into multiple chunks and compressing each chunk in parallel using threads.

Decompress files by reading the compressed chunks and decompressing them concurrently, then reconstructing the original file.

Demonstrate performance gains by comparing execution time with different numbers of threads (e.g., 1 vs 2 vs 4+).

Showcase the use of C++ Standard Library multithreading (std::thread) and the zlib compression library (or similar).

The deliverable is a working command-line tool that accepts input/output filenames and the desired number of threads, then reports timing results for compression and decompression.

This project highlights:

File handling (reading/writing binary files).

Multithreading for workload parallelization.

Practical performance measurement in C++ applications.
